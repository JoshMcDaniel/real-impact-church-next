By voluntary transgression he fell in the Garden of Eden; all descendants of Adam inherit his sin nature and the only hope of redemption is in Jesus Christ, the Son of God – specifically His death, burial, and resurrection. Salvation is a gift from God. When placing one’s faith in Jesus Christ (plus nothing, minus nothing), one is justified before God upon the merits of Jesus Christ. Salvation is by grace through faith via repentance toward God.",
