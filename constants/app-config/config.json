By voluntary transgression he fell in the Garden of Eden; all descendants of Adam inherit his sin nature and the only hope of redemption is in Jesus Christ, the Son of God â€“ specifically His death, burial, and resurrection. Salvation is a gift from God. When placing oneâ€™s faith in Jesus Christ (plus nothing, minus nothing), one is justified before God upon the merits of Jesus Christ. Salvation is by grace through faith via repentance toward God.",
